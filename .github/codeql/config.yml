# CodeQL Configuration
#
# This config excludes test files from certain security queries that
# produce false positives in test code.

# Disable specific queries that produce false positives in test files
query-filters:
  # Exclude incomplete URL substring sanitization alerts in test files
  # (test code uses mock URLs for verification purposes)
  - exclude:
      id: py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization
      path-pattern: tests/.*

  # Exclude commented-out code alerts for section headers in test files
  - exclude:
      id: py/commented-out-code
      path-pattern: tests/.*

  # Exclude unused local variable alerts in test files
  # (test variables are used in assertions that CodeQL doesn't always detect)
  - exclude:
      id: py/unused-local-variable
      path-pattern: tests/.*

  # Exclude unused import alerts in test files
  # (test imports are used dynamically or for fixtures)
  - exclude:
      id: py/unused-import
      path-pattern: tests/.*
